# Stochastic-Differential-Equations
This is the final project of Laboratory of Computational Physics (mod. B)

## Language:
Python

## Description:
Nature, industry, and human society are teeming with phenomena, processes, and systems that evolve with the effects of random noise. 
Examples of such systems include the motion of Brownian particles in a fluid, the evolution of tumors driven by tumor-immune interactions, 
the price of stocks, and the movement of winds. 
Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a powerful mathematical approach for modeling and analyzing systems affected by random noise.
In this project, to determine the force field parameters from stochastic trajectories, we dedicate three different approaches for the force field inference.
